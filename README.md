# Conference
A collection of resources for running trainings on SciSpark.

This repository is where we are building a collection of Zeppelin Notebooks that will be used for running three workshop sessions at the [ESIP Summer Conference](http://commons.esipfed.org/2016SummerMeeting): 
* [SciSpark 101: Introduction to Scala for Scientists](http://commons.esipfed.org/node/9028)
* [SciSpark 202: Algorithms for MCC Search and PDF Clustering using SciSpark](http://live.commons.esipfed.bluedotapps.org/node/9029)
* [SciSpark 303: Advanced SciSpark Usage for Building your own Climate Metrics](http://commons.esipfed.org/node/9030)

## General Plan
- Develop iPython / Zeppelin Notebooks for all three workshops
- Capture snapshots of Notebooks along with other documentation and put it on the SciSpark web site, forming a standalone tutorial for use after first workshops.
- We will need to develop notebooks with complete lessons for the website and the "teacher's guide" then develop "student" editions that have space for people to play
- People involved in creating Notebooks and web site:
[sujen1412](https://github.com/), [kwhitehall](https://github.com/kwhitehall), Valerie Roth, [rahulpalamuttam](https://github.com/rahulpalamuttam), [Loren](https://github.com/lawongsta), [BrianWilson1](https://github.com/BrianWilson1), [wmburke](https://github.com/wmburke)
- Workshop Participants can use SciSpark in three ways:
   - Standalone Spark on their laptops
   - SciSpark Cluster
   - Cluster at AWS brought up for the workshops
