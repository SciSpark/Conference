Presenters: Chris, Brian, maybe Rahul

The plan is to present about 45 minutes of teaching material and then give the attendees the rest 
of the time to run through provided exercises (in Notebooks) on their own and ask questions.

* To help teach beginning scala: datatypes, objects, classes, 
* Generic Spark scala and pyspark examples, intro. to SciTensor, ND4J
